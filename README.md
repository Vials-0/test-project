# Test Project

A test project with a front end and a CRUD API for a code challenge

## Notes

Be sure to run...

```bash
npm install
```

... in both the /frontend directory and the /backend directory to install necessary packages

You'll also need to create a .env file in the /backend directory, specifying a port number for the express server to use

## Usage

To spin up API server
```bash
cd backend/ && node server.js
```

To start front end
```bash
cd frontend/ && npm start
```

Then navigate to localhost:3000
